    "# Distributed Deep Q-Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to implement and experiment with both single-core and distributed versions of the deep reinforcement learning algorithm Deep Q Networks (DQN). In particular, DQN will be run in the classic RL benchmark Cart-Pole and abblation experiments will be run to observe the impact of the different DQN components. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant content about DQN can be found Q-Learning and SARSA are in the following course notes from CS533.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://oregonstate.instructure.com/courses/1719746/files/75047394/download?wrap=1\n",
    "\n",
    "The full pseudo-code for DQN is on slide 45 with prior slides introducing the individual components. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap of DQN \n",
    "\n",
    "From the course slides it can be seen that DQN is simply the standard table-based Q-learning algorithm but with three extensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Use of function approximation via a neural network instead of a Q-table. \n",
    "2) Use of experience replay. \n",
    "3) Use of a target network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extension (1) allows for scaling to problems with enormous state spaces, such as when the states correspond to images or sequences of images. Extensions (2) and (3) are claimed to improve the robustness and effectiveness of DQN compared. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) adjusts Q-learning so that updates are not just performed on individual experiences as they arrive. But rather, experiences are stored in a memory buffer and updates are performed by sampling random mini-batches of experience tuples from the memory buffer and updating the network based on the mini-batch. This allows for reuse of experience as well as helping to reduce correlation between successive updates, which is claimed to be beneficial. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) adjusts the way that target values are computed for the Q-learning updates. Let $Q_{\\theta}(s,a)$ be the function approximation network with parameters $\\theta$ for representing the Q-function. Given an experience tuple $(s, a, r, s')$ the origional Q-learning algorithm updates the parameters so that $Q_{\\theta}(s,a)$ moves closer to the target value: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "r + \\beta \\max_a' Q_{\\theta}(s',a') \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Rather, DQN stores two function approximation networks. The first is the update network with parameters $\\theta$, which is the network that is continually updated during learning. The second is a target network with parameters $\\theta'$. Given the same experience tuple, DQN will update the parameters $\\theta$ so that $Q_{\\theta}(s,a)$ moves toward a target value based on the target network:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "r + \\beta \\max_a' Q_{\\theta'}(s',a') \n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Periodically the target network is updated with the most recent parameters $\\theta' \\leftarrow \\theta$. This use of a target network is claimed to stabilize learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the assignment you will get to see an example of the impact of both the target network and experience replay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further reading about DQN and its application to learning to play Atari games can be found in the following paper. \n",
